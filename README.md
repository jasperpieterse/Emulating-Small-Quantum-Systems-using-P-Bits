# Emulating Small Quantum Systems using P-Bits  

This repository contains the **code and manuscript** for our final project in **Neuromorphic Computing (SOW-MKI96)**. The project explores how **probabilistic bits (p-bits)** can be used as a neuromorphic approach for representing **quantum many-body wavefunctions**.  

We investigate two key approaches:  
- **Logic-based approach** – Using p-bits in **probabilistic spin logic** to encode quantum states [1].  
- **Machine learning approach** – Exploring the potential of p-bits for **hardware acceleration** in Neural Quantum States [2,3].  

While this study is primarily theoretical, it demonstrates how **p-bits could offer an energy-efficient alternative** for representing complex quantum systems. However, further experiments with dedicated hardware are needed to fully assess their effectiveness.  

For a detailed explanation, refer to the **attached manuscript**.
